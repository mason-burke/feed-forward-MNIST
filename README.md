# feed-forward-MNIST

My first deep learning project, completed for my deep learning class in Fall 2021. This project uses a single feed-forward layer to classify the MNIST digit dataset into 10 classes, one for each digit. The accuracy of this classification was 90%. While simple, this project is notable because it does not rely on any pre-packaged TensorFlow methods/structures, and computes everything from a raw and mathematical standpoint.

I wrote all of the code for this project except for the data visualization functions in assignment.py.

To run this project, navigate to the project's directory, download the data, and setup the virtual environment. This project is then ready to run. At the end of execution, the overall accuracy will be printed.
